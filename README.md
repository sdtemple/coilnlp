# coilnlp

This package contains Python functions for text data analysis. These functions are mostly sorting, list comprehensions, and methods from NLP libraries bundled into a user-friendly and documented form. Their purpose is to assist teachers and linguists that I consulted for in the analysis of blog posts.

The consulting project was to analyze text data from an online discussion board. Participants to the discussion board came from multicultural and multilingual backgrounds. They all participated in a unique online learning experience:

COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) is an approach to fostering global competence through development of a multicultural learning environment that links university classes in different countries. Using various communication technologies, students complete shared assignments and projects, with faculty members from each country co-teaching and managing coursework. Students attended universities in the United States and in Iraq.
