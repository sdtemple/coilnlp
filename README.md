# coilnlp

This package contains Python functions for text data analysis. These functions are mostly sorting, list comprehensions, and methods from NLP libraries bundled into a user-friendly and documented form. Their purpose is to assist teachers and linguists that I consulted for in the analysis of blog posts.

Example Analyses:
* words
* words

Console:
* `build_docs()` : build documents corpus
* `build_sent()` : build sentences corpus

Functions:
* `find_word_in_sentences()` : word search in corpus
* `word_counts()` : word counts
* `ngrams()` : compound words; word associations
* `make_word_cloud()` : word cloud
* `top_tfidf_terms()` : most/least frequent words per document
* `novel_words()` : words not in wordnet
* `lda()` : latent Dirichlet allocation
* `lda_topics()` : topics from LDA model
* `nmf()` : non-negative matrix factorization
* `nmf_topics()` : topics from NMF model
* `polarity_counts()` : polarity from TextBlob rule-based sentiment

The consulting project was to analyze text data from an online discussion board. Participants to the discussion board came from multicultural and multilingual backgrounds. They all participated in a unique online learning experience:

COIL (Collaborative Online International Learning) is an approach to fostering global competence through development of a multicultural learning environment that links university classes in different countries. Using various communication technologies, students complete shared assignments and projects, with faculty members from each country co-teaching and managing coursework. Students attended universities in the United States and in Iraq.
